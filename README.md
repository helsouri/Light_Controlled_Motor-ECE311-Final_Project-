# Light_Controlled_Motor-ECE311-Final_Project-
## Summary
The motor should function such that it is on when light level is low and off when light level is high. <br>
Need to also theoretically demonstare the ability of the circuit to output a frequency on a speaker <br> <br>
**Files included are the full report with detailed explanation along with an image of the physical build**
